0.4.10
 - ref: make `util` submodule available upon import
0.4.9
 - build: setup.py test is deprecated
 - build: moved from travisCI to GitHub Actions
 - docs: refurbish docs
 - tests: allow 2D Fourier mapping test to fail on macOS
   and Windows (don't know why it fails, probably unstable)
 - ref: replace np.complex256 with np.complex128 in
   _alg_int.py:integrate which does not break any tests but
   works on Windows which sometimes has not support for longdouble
 - ref: replace np.bool with bool due to numpy deprecation warnings
0.4.8
 - ref: move sinogram generation in tests to separate file, thanks @SZanko
 - ref: deprecation warning int for numpy 1.20.0, thanks @SZanko
 - ref: more type hints, thanks @SZanko
0.4.7
 - ref: added PEP 484 type hints, thanks @SZanko (#3)
0.4.6
 - maintenance release
0.4.5
 - setup: bump scipy to 1.4.0 (updated QHull in griddata)
0.4.4
 - fix: correctly increment `count` in `_alg_fmp.py`
0.4.3
 - fix: correctly compute `max_count` for 3D wrapper
0.4.2
 - fix: use `Value.get_lock()` when tracking progress
 - docs: minor improvements
0.4.1
 - docs: add index link and include changelog
0.4.0
 - BREAKING CHANGE: volumetric reconstruction is now done according to
   the ODTbrain indexing convention. To get the original behavior,
   transpose the output, i.e. ``volout.transpose(1, 0, 2)``.
0.3.2
 - ci: automated deployment with travis-ci
0.3.1
 - Convenience fix: Make algorithm source files private
